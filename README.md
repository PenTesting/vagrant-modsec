#Modsecurity Test Environment

(https://github.com/xpn/vagrant-modsec)

This vagrant box spins up a very basic Apache HTTP server configured with modsecurity.

Note: This host is only for testing modsecurity rules.

To use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xpn/vagrant-modsec.git
cd vagrant-node
vagrant up
```

######Note: This box is not to be used for anything other than local testing.
